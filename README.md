# React Timeseries Charts

This library contains a set of modular charting components used for building flexible interactive charts. It was built for React from the ground up, specifically to visualize timeseries data and network traffic data in particular. Low level elements are constructed using d3, while higher level composability is provided by React. Charts can be stacked as rows, overlaid on top of each other, or any combination, all in a highly declarative manner.

The library is used throughout the public facing [ESnet Portal](http://my.es.net).

Current features of the library include:

 * Declarative layout of charts using JSX
 * Interactivity, including pan and zoom
 * Add new chart types or overlays
 * Multiple axis, multiple rows
 * Line, area, scatter, bar and boxplot charts
 * Brushing
 * Legends
 * Overlay markers

Please browse the [examples](http://software.es.net/react-timeseries-charts) for a feel for the library.

Getting started
---------------

This charts library is intended to be installed with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and the built into your project with a tool like [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). It expects React to be present, as well as our TimeSeries abstraction library, [pond.js](http://software.es.net/pond). More on this below. To install:

    npm install react-timeseries-charts pondjs --save

Once installed, you can import the necessary components from the library:

    import { Charts, ChartContainer, ChartRow, YAxis, LineChart } from "react-timeseries-charts";

Then we construct our chart in the `render()` function of our component. For a simple example we create a chart with two line charts on it, specified in JSX:

    <ChartContainer timeRange={series1.timerange()} width={800}>
        <ChartRow height="200">
            <YAxis id="axis1" label="AUD" min={0.5} max={1.5} width="60" type="linear" format="$,.2f"/>
            <Charts>
                <LineChart axis="axis1" series={series1}/>
                <LineChart axis="axis2" series={series2}/>
            </Charts>
            <YAxis id="axis2" label="Euro" min={0.5} max={1.5} width="80" type="linear" format="$,.2f"/>
        </ChartRow>
    </ChartContainer>

At the outer most layer, we add a `<ChartContainer>` which contains our time range for the x-axis. All charts within a ChartContainer share the same x-axis. In this case we get the TimeRange from the TimeSeries itself, but you could specify one yourself. You also need to provide a width for the chart, or wrap the chart in a `<Resizable>` component and that will inject a width for you.

For the next layer of the layout we make a `<ChartRow>`. We can have multiple charts stacked on top of each other by using more than one row. In this case we just have one row. Each row has a specific height in the layout, so we specify that as 200px high here.

Next up we want to put something in our row. Rows contain two parts:
1. a central flexible sized area in which charts can be added and 2. axes on either the left or right of the central area.

This central area is surrounded in the JSX by the `<Charts>` tag. Each chart in this area is composited on top of each other. In this case we are adding two `<LineChart>`s, one for each of our timeseries. As a result they will be drawn on top of each other. (Note that as of v0.9, it is also possible to draw multiple channels of a TimeSeries as multiple line charts). For scaling each chart will reference an axis that will define the scale as well as display that scale visually as the y-axis.

Finally, we specify the axes that the charts reference. These go either before or after the `<Charts>` group, depending on if you want the axis before (to the left) or after the charts (to the right). You can specify any number of axes on either side. For each `<YAxis>` you specify the `id` so that a chart can reference it, the `label` you want displayed alongside the axis and, importantly, the scale using `min` and `max`. You can also specify the `type` of the axis (`linear`, `log`, etc), a non-default `width` and the `format`.

For more details, please see the API docs.

Data format
-----------

This charting library is built on the ESnet timeseries library called [pond.js](http://software.es.net/pond). Pond.js was created to provide a common representation for things like time series, time ranges, events and other structures as well as to implement common operations on those structures.

For the purpose of using the charting library, you need to create a `TimeSeries` object as your time series, which will be rendered by the chart code. Constructing a TimeSeries is pretty simple. You just need to pass it an object that contains, at a minimum, the column names as an array, and a list of points.

For example:

    import { TimeSeries, TimeRange } from "pondjs";

    const data = {
        name: "traffic",
        columns: ["time", "in", "out"],
        points: [
            [1400425947000, 52, 41],
            [1400425948000, 18, 45],
            [1400425949000, 26, 49],
            [1400425950000, 93, 81],
            ...
        ]
    };

    const timeseries = new TimeSeries(data);


Generally `columns` must have 'time' as the first column (see the Pond.js docs for other options), and `points` is of the format:

    [[time, value], [time, value], ...]

Note that there are several ways to construct a TimeSeries. The above is what we call our wire format.

To specify a ChartContainer you also need to provide the time range to plot on the x-axis. This is done with a pond.js `TimeRange`. You could either get the TimeRange from the TimeSeries directly:

    var timerange = timeseries.timerange()

Or construct a new one:

    var timerange = new TimeRange([begin, end]);

where `begin` and `end` are times (Javascript Dates, usually).

How you manage this is application specific. We often have pages where the current time range being shown is kept in the `this.state` of the component and is updated during pan and zoom, both via interaction with the charts or via other controls on the page.

Developing
----------

The repo contains the examples website. This is very helpful in developing new functionality. Within a cloned repo, you first need to run:

    npm install

This will install the development dependencies into your node_modules directory.

You can then start up the test server:

    npm run start-website

Then, point your browser to:

[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

Before submitting a Pull Request, run:
    
    npm run build
    
In case you want to demonstrate an issue with the library via an example, you can use [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/).

A simple BarChart example has been built here - [https://codesandbox.io/s/3j0540mo5](https://codesandbox.io/s/3j0540mo5)
